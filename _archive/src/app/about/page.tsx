                <p>Helping you build a site that works the first time</p>
              </div>
              <p>I specifically specialisein Front-end and WordPress. I can convert a design into a website, be it static site or WordPress.</p>

              <p>My name is Aurelian Spodarec. You've probably had experience working with people claiming they have 5 or 10 yeears of experience, and they are the best.
                While some might be good - as everyone claims to be - many times it turns out to be a different story!
              </p>

              <p>Let me tell you something. I don't have 10years of experience. What I do have is a process. It's a step-by-step guide that will help us get result you want.</p>
              <p>To keep the right perspective, I like to keep things organized and clean. Using a web-based services like Trello, you will know what I'm working on, and we will stay organized.</p>

              <p>This websites is pixel-perfect and future-proof. I don't merely make the websites beautiful on the outside, it's also beautiful under the hood; the code will be clean, modular and ready to hand off to any developer, or use in production. In addition, I reinforce this with methodologies that promote organization and keep the code high-quality. I utilize BEM, OOCSS, and all that jargon you don't want to hear. That translates to saving you money in the long term.</p>
              <p>Choose me for your next Front-end project, weather that's taking a PSD or Sketch to HTTML, or to WordPress.</p>

              <p>You can learn more about me from <a href="">my blog</a>, on what is it that I do, <a href="">LoveToCode</a>, where I write about technology and other interesting things. I like to contribute to the community and share my knowledge with others. Stay tuned to see my work on Youtube.</p>
