    question: "How long does a website take to build?",
    answer:
      "I'm Aurelian Spodarec — a developer and designer who saw too many businesses stuck with underperforming websites and disjointed teams. I build strategic, fast, conversion-focused sites and front-end interfaces — whether it’s a landing page or a SaaS product — all handled by one person who gets it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why choose you over a freelancer, agency, or in-house developer?",
    answer: `Agencies are expensive and slow. Freelancers can be inconsistent. And managing multiple people is a hassle.

I handle strategy, copy, design, and development — so you get quality, consistency, and speed without juggling 3+ people.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take?",
    answer: `1-2 weeks, it all depends how much information & feedback you provide. Can be faster! Front-End SaaS will need to be estimated.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do we start?",
    answer:
      "We begin with a free intro call to align on goals. Then you share a bit about your business and what you need — and I’ll get to work right after.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's payment like?",
    answer:
      "We prefer 100% upfront, but 50/50 is possible as well. All done through stripe, and for UK customers a bank transfer will do.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I’m not happy with the result?",
    answer:
      "There are no refunds — but I offer unlimited revisions until you're 100% satisfied. I don’t stop until it’s right.",
  },
